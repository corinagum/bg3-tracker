# BG3 tracker

I want to track my Baldur's Gate 3 achievements my way.

## Usage

1. Run `npm run fetch-achievements` to fetch the achievements from the achievements page and download all icons.
   - This only needs to be done once, or whenever you want to refresh the data.
   - You can also run `npm run fetch-achievements -- --retry` to retry only failed downloads.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
